# Morningside Tickets

This is a fixed-price ticket marketplace for verified Columbia and Barnard
students. Sellers create listings; buyers reserve a quantity and enter a private
deal chat. The app never handles payment or ticket transfer.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run db:studio
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Core lifecycle

- Listing: `OPEN | SOLD_OUT | CANCELLED`. Expiry is computed from `expiresAt`.
- Deal: `RESERVED | COMPLETED | CANCELLED | EXPIRED`.
- `reserveListing` atomically decrements available inventory before creating a deal.
- A deal opens chat and reveals contact details immediately.
- Cancelling or expiring a deal restores quantity unless the listing was cancelled or expired.
- Both parties independently confirm completion before reputation and last-sale data update.
- Reservation expiry is handled by the protected cron route.

Money is stored as integer cents. Acting user IDs always come from the server
session. Event listing pages do not select seller identity. Email, phone, and
notes are otherwise restricted to deal participants or the allowlisted admin
area.

There is one admin tier. Access is controlled only by the two-email allowlist in
`src/lib/admin.ts`; do not add database roles or admin invitations. Admins can
inspect all users and their histories at `/admin/users`, and all trades at
`/admin/deals`.

Mutations live in `src/lib/actions/`. Schema changes that ship require a committed
PostgreSQL migration because Vercel runs `prisma migrate deploy` during builds.

Local dev login is controlled by `ALLOW_DEV_LOGIN=true` and is always disabled in
production. Phone onboarding requires Firebase unless test data is marked verified
directly in the database.
